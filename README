Contextual-Return-Wrapper version 0.01
======================================

This module is functionally identical to Attribute::Context.

The primary intention is to allow list-mutator functions to automatically 
do the right thing when called in scalar context.

More generally, it wraps any arbitrary list-mutator to effect various
predefined functionality based on attribute style selectors.  The resulting
functionality is dependent on context determined by implicitly calling 
the wantarray operator.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:
